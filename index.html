    <h2 style="color: brown">Things that did not necessarily go well</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The weather was so cold</li>
        <li>There is one dish I tried and it messed with my stomach</li>
        <li>I was somehow challenging to clean the washroom very well before going to class</li>
        <li>For first time, it was difficult for me to arrenge wardrobe</li>
